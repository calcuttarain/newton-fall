# Newton's Fall

## Overview

Newton's Fall is a dynamic 2D game blending physics-based challenges with an endless falling mechanic. 
Built with Box2D for realistic physics and SFML for rendering, it features procedurally generated levels, 
varied obstacles, a reinforcement learning component, and a modular design for extensibility.

This project also includes a Go-based backend, featuring a CLI menu for user interactions and a server component that coordinates with the main application. It handles authentication, resource management, and communication with the Node.js server.

Additionally, the system incorporates a database (SQLite) to store user information, scores, and other relevant details, ensuring persistent data management and seamless integration with both the Go-based backend and Node.js server.
